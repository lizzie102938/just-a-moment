This is a WIP, but once it's complete it will be a Full-Stack Next.js project which incorporates multiple public APIs and allows for CRUD actions to be carried out on the database.

## What's it about

This project is for those wishing to travel the World without leaving their living room 🌍 Users can see photos of anywhere in the World by clicking on the map or typing in a place in the search bar. They will be show images from Unsplash API which are fetched using a Reverse Geocoder function I wrote. This takes the places coordinates and translates them into the place name.

Once users have seen photos of their selected place they can add this location to their Bucket List which will be saved to a backend database.

Users can also find out about the food in each place (TheMealDB API) 🌮, as well as any global news related to the area and radio channels (Radio Browser) they can listen to 🎵

There will also be a fun feature where users will be shown a random photo of a place and will have to guess where the image is from.

It will be deployed on Vercel 🚀

Happy travels!
